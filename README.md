# Dailies

## Rules

* every day
* make something
* sufficiently novel &
* publish the result

Inspired by [Robbie Tilton](https://medium.com/@robbietilton/putting-in-the-work-38604d1b2d27#.sjl5x9atf), [Saskia Freeke](http://sasj.tumblr.com/) and [Zach Lieberman](https://medium.com/@zachlieberman/daily-sketches-2016-28586d8f008e#.e8z6uutoc) I decided to do dailies. Every day and publishing are relatively straightforward rules. Make something means for me to create an arragmenet of (moving) pixels that I like, that help me develop an idea or that help me understand a problem. Sufficiently novel means that it's ok for me to re-create something I've seen but not that I can publish old stuff of mine.

## Structure

This repository will get ore and more branches as I'm developping ideas. When I feel like an idea is ready & I made the code pretty, I will merge the branch back to master. This will also help me document my process and the relationship of different paths.
